            This dashboard analyzes procurement activity for a mid-sized
            Indonesian coal-mining operation — the suppliers it buys from, the
            purchase orders it raises, and how those orders move through the
            procure-to-pay (P2P) lifecycle.
          </p>
          <p>
            Procurement in heavy industry is high-stakes and high-volume: a small
            number of strategic suppliers account for the bulk of spend, late
            deliveries can halt production, and manual processes create payment
            delays and exception rework. The dashboard addresses three blind
            spots that procurement teams typically struggle with — visibility
            into <strong>spend concentration</strong>, into{" "}
            <strong>supplier quality and risk</strong>, and into{" "}
            <strong>process efficiency</strong> — by turning raw transaction data
            into three fixed, defensible analyses.

          <p>
            The underlying data is synthetic, but it is calibrated against
            published industry benchmarks so that the patterns (spend skew, cycle
            times, quality distributions) are realistic and the analytical methods
            can be demonstrated meaningfully.

              Cycle time is near-deterministic in buying method, and the threshold sits
              around 160 days — above the <em>maximum</em> cycle of every method except
              one. Spot buys top out at 68 days, call-offs at 109, RFQs and tenders at
              149; only direct awards (max 171) can reach it at all. Every flagged order
              in the current data is a direct award. So the flag is, in effect, a proxy
              for &ldquo;this was a direct purchase&rdquo; — which is why the buying
              method is shown next to each listed order. A long cycle on a direct award

              This section follows the same principle as Section 9.5: a measure that

              relabelled. The rule is unchanged and the numbers are unchanged — only the
              description has been corrected to match what is actually computed.

              Period comparison is a <strong>midpoint split of the currently
              selected period</strong> — its first half against its second — so it
              measures drift <em>within</em> the period, not year over year. The

            Each supplier carries a 0–100 <strong>composite performance score</strong>,
            built from four sub-scores that are <strong>derived in code from raw
            operational data</strong> (deliveries, three-way-match results, and per-PO
            quality records — defect and complaint counts). Every sub-score is normalized
            to 0–100 against <strong>fixed industry bounds</strong>, so a supplier is
            measured against absolute standards — not against whoever else happens to be
            in the dataset. The source data contains <strong>operational measurements
            only</strong>; all scorecard values are computed in code (
            <code>python/scores.py</code>) at import, so every stored score is

              when the analyses are read against one another, grouped into three

                <em>percentile ranks</em> on spend, performance, and supply risk
                spread by <strong>80 points or more</strong>: it ranks very

              <li>
                <strong>Changed over time</strong> — a supplier with a sharp
                year-over-year move: a spend fold of <strong>≥ 2.5×</strong>, a
                Kraljic quadrant jump, or a composite-score swing of{" "}
                <strong>≥ 18 points</strong>. A partial trailing year (under half the

                regional-but-foreign origins. This roster has none — every supplier
                is Indonesian or far-international — so those tiers never engage.
                Because <code>country_distance</code>{" "}
                drives 60% of the structural Risk sub-score, on this data that

                fires — the advertised ceilings (50 on the Kraljic axis, 100 on the
                composite) cannot be reached. The real maxima on this data are{" "}

              A call-off draws on an agreement that in real procurement was competed
              once, at framework award. This schema records no sourcing linkage on the
              framework — no awarding event, no responses — so the data cannot establish
              whether any given framework was competitively awarded. Folding call-offs
              into &ldquo;competed&rdquo; would overstate competitive coverage by the
              whole framework share; folding them into &ldquo;uncompeted&rdquo; would
              overstate that side by the same amount. Reporting a single
              &ldquo;competitive %&rdquo; is therefore not possible without introducing
              an error equal to the largest bucket in the portfolio.

            </h3>
            <p>
              Competitive coverage is strongly <em>associated</em> with category —
              proprietary OEM parts are bought direct because they cannot be competed,
              not because anyone declined to compete them — so part of any year-over-year
              move is simply a change in what was bought. Coverage is therefore
              decomposed by category using <strong>shift-share</strong>. For each bucket,
              with <code>w</code> = a category&rsquo;s share of period spend and{" "}
              <code>r</code> = the bucket&rsquo;s share of that category&rsquo;s spend:

              <strong>−3.51 was mix and −6.37 within</strong> — about two thirds of it a
              genuine change in how the same categories were bought. The 2026 recovery
              (+7.43) is almost entirely within-category. An earlier draft of the
              emitter&rsquo;s own documentation asserted the opposite, that the move was
              mostly a mix shift, and the decomposition disproved it. The dashboard and

              This is an arithmetic identity with no distributional assumptions. There
              are deliberately no p-values on it, and nothing in it may be read as
              inference. The decomposition runs over the whole dataset, so a transition
              reads the same on every period selection.

            </h3>
            <p>
              Coverage is <strong>descriptive</strong>. High-value spend concentrates in
              the sole-source and framework channels — median order value runs roughly
              $58K for spot buys, $608K for RFQs, $1.2M for tenders, $2.1M for direct
              awards and $2.4M for call-offs. That is a fact about the shape of the
              portfolio, <em>not</em> a finding about buyer discipline: every direct
              award in this data carries a proprietary/OEM sole-source justification, and
              an OEM component has no substitutable competing supply. There is
              consequently no coverage score, no ranking of categories or suppliers by
              coverage, and no recommendation derived from it.

              deliberately not displayed, because on this dataset they are{" "}
              <strong>degenerate</strong>: they return the same answer for every input,
              or they measure an artifact rather than the thing they name. Each was
              tested before the decision was taken, not assumed. The first eight concern
              competitive sourcing; the ninth (payment discipline), tenth (delivery slip
              magnitude) and eleventh (requisition estimate accuracy) are recorded here
              because they are the same failure mode and belong in one catalogue.

              <li>
                <strong>Awarded the cheapest bid?</strong> 226 of 226 awards went to the
                lowest quote — price rank 1 in every event without exception. A universal
                pass communicates nothing.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Single-bid exposure.</strong> The minimum bid count per event is
                2 (31 events drew 2 bids, 165 drew 3, 30 drew 4). There are no single-bid
                events at all, so the measure is permanently zero.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Bid response rate.</strong> Suppliers invited always equals
                responses received — 2→2, 3→3, 4→4 in every event. A constant 100%.

              <li>
                <strong>Quote spread by category, supplier or period.</strong> Spread is
                an order statistic of the number of bids: 9.22% at 2 bids, 12.80% at 3,
                13.06% at 4. Holding bid count fixed at 3, the between-category range
                (11.15–13.44) is under half a single within-category standard deviation
                (3.2–4.4), and the period cut is flat at 12.85 / 12.71 / 12.84. Any
                breakdown would report the bid-count mix wearing a category label —
                &ldquo;Conveyor &amp; Belt has the tightest bidding&rdquo; is false; all
                its events simply have two bidders. The <em>portfolio</em> figure
                (12.35%) is shown; no cut of it is.

                <strong>Savings versus the field.</strong> Because the award is always
                the minimum quote, this is a deterministic re-expression of the spread
                and carries no independent information. It also has a scoping trap: a bid
                quotes ONE unit price matching ONE order line, and that line averages{" "}
                <strong>64.66%</strong> of the order&rsquo;s value. The measured
                advantage of $7.36M sits against $113.3M of awarded-line value — it must
                never be scaled onto the $177.7M of competed spend, which would overstate
                it by roughly half.

                <strong>Do we pay more when we don&rsquo;t compete?</strong> Computable

                −6.98%, standard deviation <strong>61.96%</strong>, with{" "}
                <strong>14 of the 26 items CHEAPER</strong> when uncompeted against only
                12 dearer. The scatter is roughly thirteen times the effect, and a
                majority-cheaper split makes the exclusion stronger, not weaker: the sign
                of the &ldquo;premium&rdquo; is decided by which items happen to be
                picked. A headline built on this would be fabricated.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Challengeable sole-source awards.</strong> Every direct award
                carries a proprietary/OEM justification. Counting alternatives from the
                category roster suggests some are challengeable, but the roster is far
                too coarse a proxy for item-level substitutability — the eight suppliers
                in &ldquo;Heavy Equipment OEM&rdquo; are eight different OEMs, and a
                Volvo part is not a Liebherr part.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Purchase orders dated before bid close.</strong> A genuine audit
                red flag in practice, and it fires on 51 of 226 events. On inspection the
                sourcing dates are drawn independently — close-to-order spans −8 to +15
                days — so flagging a quarter of all competitive events would manufacture
                an accusation out of noise.

              <li>
                <strong>Payment discipline against contractual terms.</strong> The
                most convincing dead metric of the set, because unlike a percentile
                threshold it has a real contractual benchmark:{" "}
                <code>paymentTerms</code> carries Net 14 / Net 30 / Net 45, so
                &ldquo;days paid past terms&rdquo; looks rigorous and needs no
                distributional assumption. Measured, it is a{" "}
                <strong>uniform random draw</strong>. Days late is an integer on
                exactly [0, 15] with χ² <em>p</em> = 0.336 against Uniform{"{"}0..15{"}"},
                an observed mean of <strong>7.27</strong> against the theoretical
                7.50 and sd 4.54 against 4.61. Nothing explains any of its variance —
                supplier <em>p</em> = 0.92, category 0.96, period 0.64, buying method
                0.55, term bucket 0.49. A permutation test settles it: the observed
                spread of supplier means (1.59) is <em>below</em> what random
                reassignment produces (1.72), <em>p</em> = 0.747 — supplier
                differences are not weak signal, they are less varied than chance.
                Zero of 22 large suppliers reject uniformity on a test of their full
                distribution shape (≈1.1 expected by chance), and no supplier reaches
                |z| &gt; 2 against the grand mean. ⚠️ The observation that the
                organisation &ldquo;pays about 7 days late and never early&rdquo; is
                arithmetically correct but describes the generator&rsquo;s
                non-negative lower bound, not payment discipline: a draw from [0, 15]
                has no early tail by construction. A worst-payers league table built
                on this would render beautifully and name innocent suppliers.

                <strong>Delivery slip magnitude.</strong> Delivery is recorded as a
                boolean (on time against the promised date). The obvious refinement is
                to measure <em>how late</em> — 483 of 647 orders (74.7%) are late,
                averaging +7.9 days and reaching +33. Unlike payment lag this is not a
                simple uniform draw (χ² rejects Uniform at <em>p</em> = 1.3 × 10⁻⁴⁷,
                early deliveries exist at 21.0%), but it carries{" "}
                <strong>no supplier information</strong>. Slip magnitude given the
                order was late has ρ = −0.196, <em>p</em> = 0.207 against supplier
                on-time rate — it adds nothing the boolean does not already say — and a
                permutation test on the spread of supplier mean slip gives{" "}
                <em>p</em> = 0.471, dead on the null. ⚠️{" "}
                <strong>

                at the global rate: at supplier-period grain the binomial dispersion is
                χ²/df = 1.03 (<em>p</em> = 0.411) — exactly binomial — and an exact
                label permutation gives <em>p</em> = 0.955. There is no supplier signal
                to refine. Lead time, meanwhile, is <strong>73–86% determined by
                buying method</strong> (73.0% of order-level variance; method mix
                explains 86.4% of between-supplier variance), with no residual supplier
                effect (<em>p</em> = 0.266) and <strong>zero cross-channel
                consistency</strong> — across 32 suppliers using two or more methods, a
                supplier&rsquo;s lead residual in one channel does not predict its
                residual in another (<em>r</em> = −0.015, <em>p</em> = 0.933). See
                Section 10.3 for what this does and does not imply.

                An earlier pass reported that the lead-time half &ldquo;drives&rdquo; the
                score, from correlations of +0.880 (lead) against +0.555 (on-time). That
                was an artifact: both halves are components of their own sum, so both
                correlate positively with it by construction, and a raw standard
                deviation is not a variance share. Under the same covariance
                decomposition used elsewhere here, the two halves contribute{" "}
                <strong>almost equally — on-time 48.6%, lead 51.4%</strong>; a drop-one
                rank test agrees (Spearman +0.727 dropping the lead half, +0.794
                dropping the on-time half). delivery_score is therefore roughly half
                coin-flip and half channel proxy, not lead-dominated. The

                does not reject (<em>p</em> = 0.083); and the shape is a pure location
                shift, since recentring their draws on the window mean restores
                uniformity (<em>p</em> = 0.176). A per-requester estimating scorecard is
                therefore not a weak finding to be shored up with more data. It is

              <code>supply_risk_score</code> correlate at <strong>r = −0.852</strong>. The
              sign is negative by design — composite Risk is oriented so that higher is{" "}
              <em>safer</em>, Kraljic supply risk so that higher is <em>riskier</em> — and
              the magnitude is high because both are built on the same structural
              roster-concentration measure (Sections 4.3 and 3.2). They are two
              presentations of one quantity, not two readings of a supplier. So wherever
              Risk leads the composite&rsquo;s variance, the composite&rsquo;s largest
              single contributor is a number already plotted as the vertical axis of the
              Classification page.

              44.0%, and on 2026 it is 37.3% against Delivery&rsquo;s 46.4% — Delivery

              (b) Kraljic and Performance-vs-Spend share an entire axis
            </h4>
            <p>
              Both matrices split on <em>the same</em> log-spend median — 15.2464 — so
              their horizontal axes are not merely similar but identical. The consequence
              is visible in the cross-tab: the quadrant × zone table has{" "}
              <strong>zero off-diagonal cells on the spend split</strong>. Strategic and
              Leverage suppliers map only into Stars and Critical Issues; Bottleneck and
              Routine map only into Hidden Gems and Long Tail. That is not an empirical
              near-miss to be explained; it is one median applied twice. The two analyses
              differ only in their <em>second</em> axis — supply risk against performance.
            </p>
            <p>
              ABC collapses further still: its cutpoints are taken on cumulative spend, so
              class membership is spend rank by construction and correlates with the
              supplier ranking at approximately 1.0. Taken together, the
              supplier-classification trio is{" "}
              <strong className="text-foreground">
                spend, supply risk and delivery-driven performance replotted three ways
              </strong>{" "}
              — three views, not three independent analyses.
            </p>
            <p>
              ⚠️ Unlike (a), this is <strong>structural rather than data-dependent</strong>.
              Any dataset would produce the shared axis, because both frameworks are
              anchored on spend deliberately: Kraljic&rsquo;s horizontal axis <em>is</em>{" "}
              profit impact proxied by spend, and ABC <em>is</em> a spend-ranking method. A
              different concentration profile would move which suppliers land in which
              cell; it would never make the axis stop being shared.

              (c) Even quadrant and zone populations are forced by the median split
            </h4>
            <p>
              Performance zones divide <strong>14 / 13 / 13 / 15</strong> across the
              all-years window, and Kraljic quadrants <strong>14 / 11 / 12 / 14</strong> in
              2025. Both are approximately quartiles, and both are approximately quartiles{" "}
              <strong className="text-foreground">by construction</strong>: a median puts
              half the population on each side of it, so crossing two medians yields four
              cells near <em>n</em>/4 unless the two axes are strongly correlated.

                &ldquo;the quadrants are balanced&rdquo; and &ldquo;no zone is
                empty&rdquo; are not findings about the supplier base
              </strong>{" "}
              — they are arithmetic, and they would hold on almost any input. Neither
              should be read as evidence of a healthy or well-diversified portfolio. The
              genuinely informative case is the opposite one: a <em>strongly skewed</em>{" "}
              cross-tab would indicate the two axes are correlated, which is exactly what
              the shared spend axis in (b) produces. This point is purely methodological —
              it is a property of median-split matrices generally, not of this dataset.

              </strong>{" "}
              Kraljic and ABC are standard frameworks applied here as specified, and their
              overlap follows from both being anchored on spend — which is what they are
              designed to do. The redundancy is the price of using two spend-anchored
              frameworks together, and it is a price worth paying, because the second axes
              genuinely differ and that is where each view earns its place. The three
              findings differ in kind, and the distinction matters when quoting them: (a)
              is a magnitude that moves with the grain, (b) is structural and would hold on
              any data, (c) is methodological and would hold for any median split. What all
              three rule out is the same habit — treating agreement between two of these
              views as independent confirmation.
