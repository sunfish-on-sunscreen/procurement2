"""Shared, pure supplier-score computation (Stage 1 of the backend-scoring rebuild).

This module is the SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH for the derived supplier scores. The
formulas were extracted VERBATIM from ``scripts/transform_dataset.py`` (which now
imports them from here) so the offline transformer and the future server-side
import path compute identical values.

Everything here is PURE and deterministic — functions take DataFrames / dicts in
and return computed values out. No file I/O, no DB, no ``rng``. Fixed industry
bounds (not population min/max) so scores are stable when data changes.

Derived fields (per active supplier-period/window). defect_rate + complaint_rate
are aggregated from per-PO defect_count / complaint_count over the filtered POs:
  defect_rate_pct    = sum(defect_count) / sum(quantity) * 100   (quantity-based)
  complaint_rate_pct = orders_with_complaint / num_pos * 100     (per-order, 0-100)
  quality  = mean(norm_low(defect_rate_pct,0,10), norm_low(complaint_rate_pct,0,100))
  delivery = mean(norm_high(otd_pct,0,100), norm_low(avg_lead_time,0,60))
  process  = norm_high(three_way_match_pct,0,100)
  risk     = 100 - (0.6*country_distance + 0.4*concentration_0_100(roster))  [structural]
  composite = 0.30*quality + 0.30*delivery + 0.22*process + 0.18*risk
The Service dimension and single_source_risk were removed. All rounded to 2 dp.
